Meteo v1.3.0


This file hopes to address several of the problems people have been having while using Meteo.  If the solutions to problems here are not clear enough or you have a problem not listed, feel free to email me at fahrenba@mac.com and I'll work on fixing your problem and updating the documentation appropriately.

#1.  All I get is N/A.
#2.  I can't find my city.
#3.  My processor usage spikes each time Meteo updates, how dare it!
#4.  The data displayed on weather.com is slightly different than what is displayed in Meteo.
#5.  The weather report is simply wrong!
#6.  Can I have x feature?
#7.  Meteo refuses to launch!
#8.  Meteo beach balls forever after editing a city
#9.  Where is localization?!?

#1.  All I get is N/A.

There's several possible things that can cause this.  The first is that you are running OS X 10.1.5 or earlier and you're using a version of Meteo prior to 1.1.4a.  After that, a bug in Apple's APIs related to loading images by URL was found and fixed.

A second possibility is that you're behind a proxy.  One users fix to this was to go into the Network Preferences, choose the proxies tab, and make sure "Use Passive FTP Mode (PASV)" is enabled.  I haven't found a way to get around the proxy problem yet, but I'm still investigating.

Yet another possibility is that you have a slow connection to the internet, or your connection is bogged down (downloading lots of files, your ISP is having issues, etc).  What happens then you may have seen happen in a web browser - after Internet Explorer tries to load a webpage for long enough and it hasn't gotten enough of the data to do so yet, it will simply display a cryptic three number error code which indicates a time out error, or the web browser just gave up on waiting for the information.  Incidentally, if weather.com is exceptionally slow, you can also experience this problem.

One final possibility - weather.com messed up.  Unfortunately, weather.com does not seem to relay all the information about a town all the time.  Meaning, even though Meteo is doing exactly what it is suppose to and downloads all the information from weather.com, all that information may already be set to N/A!  An obvious sign of this is if the long range forecast has useful information, but none of the other displayed data is useful (aka N/A).


#2.  I can't find my city.

There's two main causes for this: one, weather.com doesn't have your city listed or two, your city was misspelled.  Make sure you are spelling, spacing, and capitalizing your city properly or it won't be found.  It's possible that your city is in the weather.com database, but being an American entity, they butchered the spelling (aka, leaving out special characters like š).  The easiest way to deal with this is to email the fine people and weather.com and asking if your city was in their database and how you could access it through their web page.


#3.  My processor usage spikes each time Meteo updates, how dare it!

If that's shocking, you should watching your favorite web browser as it loads a web page.  Most of the time your processor is doing next to nothing.  When Meteo starts to process data, it asks for as much of the processor as free.  This is essentially how every app works on OS X, so it is not something to be concerned about.


#4.  The data displayed on weather.com is slightly different than what is displayed in Meteo.

This should be fixed in 1.1.6 - every conversion that I check now is absolutely accurate.  If you still find errors, please email with the details so I can track down what's going on.  The parser I'm using for both Wunderground and NWS are very young and so have some problems (most notably with parsing Wind Chill and the like).  If you find an error, just send me what you saw and for what city - it may take me a little while to find the exact cause, but I promise to do my best to track it down.


#5.  The weather report is simply wrong!

Email weather.com and complain.  If you find a better source for weather, then I'll look into supporting gathering data from that source.  I already provide Wunderground and NWS as alternatives, but if you know of a better source, just drop me a line.


#6.  Can I have x feature?

Sure, just email and I'll try to incorporate it in the next version.


#7.  Meteo refuses to launch!

The best explanation for this is probably that there is a preference problem.  There's a conflict between the old 1.1.8 preference system and 1.2.x system that I didn't notice until it was too late.  The easiest fix is to simple delete your old preferences and relaunch Meteo (the preferences are store in /Users/*username*/Library/Preferences/Meteorologist.plist).


#8.  Meteo beach balls forever after editing a city

There are a couple cases where this will happen.  The first cause would be that you activated a weather server that wasn't activated before, so Meteo has to go out and grab some new data.  Another cause would be radar images and images obtained from NWS.  Those images aren't stored locally like the other images (which account for the 1.1 MB download size), so it will take a little while for that info to be downloaded after an edit.


#9.  Where is localization?!?

Okay okay okay.  Localization is a tricky business, as I don't control the English words that come down from upon high.  Therefore, any localization that is coming in the future will be a work in progress.  That said, 1.2.4 looks to be the first public released build that should have localization partly implemented.  Between 1.2.3 and 1.2.4, I'm going to be talking to my "localizers" and getting them to collaborate when they have time to find out what is still being missed.  So sit tight; with school and such, I may be a little late in getting 1.2.4 out (unless a weather server changes their format again...)
